'''. Given a 2D matrix that represents a gold mine, where each cellâ€™s value represents an amount of gold, return the maximum amount of gold you can collect given the following rules:

    You may start and stop collecting gold from any position
    You can never visit a cell that contains 0 gold
    You cannot visit the same cell more than once
    From the current cell, you may walk one cell to the left, right, up, or down
