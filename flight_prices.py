'''
A company is booking flights to send its employees to its two satellite offices A and B.
The cost of sending the ith employee to office A and office B is given by prices[i][0] and prices[i][1] respectively.
Given that half the employees must be sent to office A and half the employees must be sent to office B,
return the minimum cost the company must pay for all their employeesâ€™ flights.

Steps I took:
    1. On the first pass, assign each employee to the office that is cheapest for them to fly to (ideal choice)
    2. Find the office that has too many employees
    3. Sort employees at that office by the cost of switching flights (not the cost of the flight itself)
    4. Switch flights until the offices have an equal number of employees

Proper solution:
    1. sort by diff / how much you save by flying to office A (could be negative). 
    2. send the first half of the sorted employees to office A
